# Technical Debt Log

## 23. Stale Test Files
- **Issue**: Several test files were identified as stale or temporary artifacts (`test_coverage_improvements.py`, `test_missing_keys.py`, `test_webapp_extra.py`, `test_check_route.py`, `test_storage_gap_fill.py`) and have been removed. Future work should continue to audit for unused tests.
- **Priority**: Low
- **Status**: In Progress.
